# wordlists
Very small wordlist including the most popular fist names (from 1970-2022) in Germany.

The list contains each name in upper- and lowercase (```Maria``` / ```maria```) and is randomized.
If you don't like that, simply use:

```plain
$ sort GER-Firstnames_1970-2022.dict > GER-Firstnames_1970-2022_new.dict
```
Had some nice results with combination attacks ```hashcat -a 1 (...)```
